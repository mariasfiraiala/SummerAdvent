# Summer Advent

Welcome to Summer Advent, a project started by the all mighty [Radu Nichita](https://github.com/RaduNichita)
where `Assembly (x86)` meets `C` meets binary exploits in a competition so fierce
only 5 people dared to participate in.

We took 3 days out of our exam preparation period in order to prove our skills
to the rest of the passive, by default participants, but, gradually, the challanges
became so alien like, I felt helpless and eventually, to my desperation, had to
drop out. Credits go to [Alex Buzea](https://github.com/alexandrubuzea) who chose the very last challange, based
on Numerical Methods knowledge; without him, my desperation wouldn't have reached
the monumental height before the final, harsh decision to give up.

This repo contains my attempts to the first 2 days challenges; if I ever become
so great at `IHS` and `MN`, I'll update the third day exercises.

Until then,

Peace :v:
